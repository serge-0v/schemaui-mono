# Schema UI Mono: Next.js + Sanity Monorepo

This starter is a part of [Schema UI](https://schemaui.com) project, a comprehensive page builder that provides production-ready React components with pre-built Sanity schemas and GROQ queries, enabling rapid development of content-driven websites with Sanity CMS and Next.js.

## Getting Started

### Installing the template

This project uses pnpm as package manager. To install pnpm globally, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Login to Sanity CLI:

```bash
sanity login
```

#### 1. Install Sanity CLI globally

```bash
pnpm install --global sanity@latest
```

#### 2. Clone the repository

Run the command in your Terminal to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serge-0v/sanityblocks.git
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd sanityblocks
pnpm install
```

This will install the dependencies for both `/frontend` and `/studio` folders.

#### 3. Create a new Sanity project

- Navigate to [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/manage) and create a new project.
- Navigate to API and add CORS origins `http://localhost:3000`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for both `/frontend` and `/studio` folders
- Add a new API token with read access (Viewer) and copy the token to `.env.local` as `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` for `/frontend`
- Copy the project ID and paste it to `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` for `/frontend` and `SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID` for `/studio`

#### 5. Run the template locally

Start the development servers:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development servers for both `/frontend` and `/studio` folders.

#### 6. Open the app and sign in to the Studio

- Open the Next.js app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Open the Studio running locally in your browser on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333). You should now see a screen prompting you to log in to the Studio. Use the same service (Google, GitHub, or email) that you used when you logged in to the CLI.

### Adding content with Sanity

#### 1. Import Sample Data (Optional)

Import the demo dataset to get started with sample content. Be careful with the `--replace` flag, it will replace all the existing data in the dataset. This is a good way to get started with the template. You can always delete the dataset and start over. This will make your site look like the demo site: [Demo](https://sanityblocks.schemaui.com/).

```bash
cd studio
sanity dataset import sample-data.tar.gz production --replace
```

#### 2. Publish your first document

The template comes pre-defined with a schema containing `Author`, `Category`, `FAQ`, `Page`, `Post`, `Testimonial`, `Contact` and `Settings` document types.

From the Studio, click "+ Create" and select the `Page` document type. Go ahead and create and publish the document.

Your content should now appear in your Next.js app ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))

#### 3. Extending the Sanity schema

The schema for the `Page` document type is defined in the `sanity/schemas/document/page.ts` file. You can [add more document types](https://www.sanity.io/docs/schema-types) to the schema to suit your needs.

### Deploying your application

#### 1. Deploy to Vercel

Deploy your website to Vercel:

1. Create a new repository on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github).
2. Push your code to GitHub
3. Create a [new Vercel project](https://vercel.com/new)
4. Connect your GitHub repository and import the project. Make sure to set the root directory to `/frontend`.
5. Copy the environment variables from the `.env.local` file and paste them to your Vercel project settings. Vercel supports pasting all variables at once.
6. Deploy

Deploy the Sanity Studio to Vercel:

1. Create a [new Vercel project](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Connect your GitHub repository and import the project. Make sure to set the root directory to `/studio`.
3. Copy the environment variables from the `.env.local` file and paste them to your Vercel project settings. Vercel supports pasting all variables at once.
4. Deploy

#### 2. Configure CORS settings

Add your domain name for both the Next.js app (for example, `https://yourwebsite.com`) and the Sanity Studio (for example, `https://sanity.yourwebsite.com/`) to the CORS Origins in your Sanity project settings to allow your deployed site to communicate with Sanity.

### Inviting collaborators

Now that you've deployed your Next.js application and Sanity Studio, you can optionally invite a collaborator to your Studio. Open up [Manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage), select your project and click "Invite project members"

They will be able to access the deployed Studio, where you can collaborate together on creating content.

## Sanity TypeGen

To generate the types, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm typegen
```

This will generate `schema.json` file in the `/studio` folder and `sanity.types.ts` file in the `/frontend` folder.
You need to run this command every time you make changes to the schema and queries. Or when you create a new document type. Otherwise, you will get type errors for frontend.

## Updating all packages

```bash
pnpm update --latest --recursive
```

## Environment variables

```bash
pnpm i -w frontend-package-name --filter ./frontend
pnpm i -w studio-package-name --filter ./studio
```

All environment variables and their descriptions:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - your website url. For example, `https://yourwebsite.com` without trailing slash. Used for sitemap.ts , robots.ts , and for client.ts
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_ENV` - specifies the environment type (development/production) and affects metadata configuration. Setting this to "development" prevents search engine indexing, which is useful for staging environments (e.g., `staging.yourwebsite.com`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_URL` - your Sanity Studio url. For example, `https://sanity.yourwebsite.com` without trailing slash. Used for Draft Mode (Open in Studio Url).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION` - your Sanity API version. You don't have to use specific dates, any past or present date is valid, and today's date will always give you the latest version - no need to check release history. For example: YYYY-MM-DD.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` - your Sanity project ID. For example, abc12345.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` - your Sanity dataset name. For example, production.
- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` - your Sanity read token for Next.js to fetch data.
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - your RESEND api key for the newsletter form.
- `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID` - your RESEND audience id for the newsletter form to store contacts.
